# No-Code-Webstie-Development-Platform
Our system asks a users what kind of website they want to create. 
We gather some information and then prepare some structure and suggest some options for look and feel.
It also provide users suggestion according to their preference. 
The system asks user series of question throughout the design progress. 
There are also some prompts user can make to get some action like getting some helps or go to generated codes to make modifications just in case user have coding experience.
